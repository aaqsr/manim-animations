# manim-animations
A few animations I made for my class or myself.
They are done using manim by 3b1b which can be found at https://github.com/3b1b/manim/
To compile this code you will need python, manim and all its dependencies.
I would like to thank 3b1b for making his code open source and free to use for us all to spread knowledge and make maths easier :)
